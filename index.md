I am a third year graduate student at the Social and Decision Neuroscience program at Caltech. My thesis advisor is [John O'Doherty][olab].

I'm broadly interested in studying reward-modulated learning and planning by humans in complex state and action spaces. I am also interested in studying capacity limitations in cognitive machinery and their manifestations in everyday decisions.

Here's my [CV][]. Feel free to [contact me][contact].
